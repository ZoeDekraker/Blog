### AI as Primary Audience 
Your first audience isnâ€™t humans now, itâ€™s AI.

Are you posting with AI as the target audience? 
You should be.

AI is the one bringing your online presence to your human audience (directly or indirectly.)

You're not just writing for people anymore.
You're writing for the one that interprets it for them.
*a whole other rabbit hole*

Something to keep in mind when posting online. ðŸ™‚
