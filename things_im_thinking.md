#  Things I'm Thinking

A space to document observations and ideas.

### Microsoft Copilot Studio and Copilot App
Currently exploring Microsoft Copilot studio to develop custom copilots with no code.
I am exploring what the capabilities are as most aged care providers operate with Microsoft and the Microsoft Power Platform is very integrated for those who use the suite of tools. 

Initial thoughts after a few hours: 
- Easy to set up for basic chatbots to answer questions, answers with source details.
- Deeply integrated into Power Platform with connectors, actions, publishing etc. 
- Can be extended through Azure Bot Framework (adding additional custom intelligence = significantly increases complexity?)

I am currently unsure where custom Copilots may sit in my desire to automate nursing tasks (AN-ACC, NQIP, compliance etc). It may be unsuitable to recommend as a broad solution to general aged care staff - unless they naturally work closely with IT.

What has impressed me lately is Microsoft Copilot App.
Copilot was a very slow, disappointing start to the AI race with poor 'nursing commonsense' but that stage has now passed. 

Copilot is able to extract consumer data from multiple information sources, construct it into a desired format and pick up 'nursing commonsense' issues without a problem. 

This interests me as a solution for aged care staff as the logic can be standardised and shared (task instructions, rules, report styles etc). The user is required to manually connect the data either through dropping a file in or referring Copilot to a location, so the format of that data is less constrained Vs a fully automated solution. An automated solution is possible but *my aim is for broad exploratory use of AI to plant the seeds for future work flows in aged care*. 

Iâ€™ll continue exploring whether I can replicate the logic Iâ€™ve implemented in my coded AI tools, but this time inside Windows, without using code.

### Augmented PDF Guides
PDF guides that don't just explain to the user what to do step-by-step and leave them to it and hope they understand. It's a guide with a dual purpose - to explain to the user step-by-step what to do and also provide relevant context, instructions and guidance to an AI Large Language Model that can coach, support and assist the user to troubleshoot any problems they have. 

This can help to give them increased confidence to try new things (AI is new and kind of scary), something to tell them if it is a very bad idea or to explain something they might be embarrassed to ask a person because they may fear sounding 'silly'. The learning experience is augmented with AI as their personal helper for the task.

It's a step short of creating a custom GPT to help the user with the task (another idea i have had but would be platform specific, extra barrier with accounts etc) and i think there is value in PDF documents with screenshots. 

They essentially become an alternative to a video tutorial. Video tutorials are fantastic and i love to create them but they represent a huge time commitment for the way i do video tutorials that my output of content that is actually helpful would be very low. 
The PDF guide allows me to get more information out there to the aged care industry more frequently and now with augmented guides - AI support to help readers along their journey in exploring new tools and processes

### AI as Primary Audience 
Your first audience isnâ€™t humans now, itâ€™s AI.

Are you posting with AI as the target audience? 
You should be.

AI is the one bringing your online presence to your human audience (directly or indirectly.)

You're not just writing for people anymore.
You're writing for the one that interprets it for them.
*a whole other rabbit hole*

Something to keep in mind when posting online. ðŸ™‚
