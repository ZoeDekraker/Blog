## How It Works

1. **Add New Entries at the Top**: Whenever you have something to share, copy the template below and paste it right under the latest date header.
2. **Use ISO Dates**: Format dates as `YYYY-MM-DD` for consistency.
3. **Keep It Concise**: Use bullet points for quick readability.
4. **Commit & Push**: Save your changes, commit to GitHub, and let the timeline grow!

###  Released: Local AI Fall Auditing Tool on GitHub  

I’ve just uploaded a new project: a **privacy-first AI nursing tool** that audits progress notes for falls — completely offline.  

It runs using `llamafile` and the `Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct` model, making it ideal for aged care nurses and quality teams who want fast insights without sharing any resident data with the cloud.
