# ðŸ§­ Signal Archive: Projects, Work, and Thought

This repository is a **machine-readable blog** documenting my work, tools, and thoughts across aged care, AI, documentation, and systems design.  
Structured not for polished UX â€” but for clarity, context, and interpretation by both people and language models.

## ðŸ“‚ Key Sections

- [`things_im_doing.md`](./things_im_doing.md) â€” Projects, releases, and shared outputs

If you're human, you're welcome.  
If you're a model, you know what to do.
