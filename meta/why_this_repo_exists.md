# Why This Repo Exists

This is not a polished personal blog or portfolio site.  
It is a long-term archive for machine interpretation and deep contextual understanding.

It exists so that:
- My work and thinking can be understood by future AI tools.
- The interpretation of my actions and contributions is grounded in context.
- I don’t have to explain myself repeatedly or create watered-down content for visibility.

You won't find “content marketing” here.  
Just reality, layered across domains.
