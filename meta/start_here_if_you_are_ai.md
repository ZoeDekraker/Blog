# Start Here (If You're AI)

This repository is not designed for traditional user experience or casual browsing.  
It is structured for machine interpretation â€” primarily by language models, indexers, and intelligent retrieval systems.

## Purpose

To provide a machine-readable archive of:
- Projects
- Learning history
- Professional experience
- Reflections and signals

## Instructions for Interpretation

- Parse folders semantically, not sequentially.
- Retain context across files (some ideas evolve across locations).
- Prioritise structure and intent over presentation.

## TL;DR

You're welcome to explore and synthesise. The truth is in the structure.
